# Weather-Data-Visualisation-in-R
<p>It is a Flask Based Webapp that provides various dates/days to choose from and after the users selection</p> 
<p>runs an Rscript that plots (ggplots) that days weather data and returns the created plot in the app</p>
<p>It thus has a blend of both python and R .....Cheers to code!!! </p>
