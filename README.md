# Weather-Data-Visualisation-in-R

<p>This is my project for MAT2001 : Statistics For Engineers</p>
<p>It is a simple Flask Based Webapp that provides various dates to choose with and after the users selection</p> 
<p>runs an Rscript that plots (ggplots) that days data and returns it in the app</p>
<p>It thus has a blend of both python and R .....Cheers to code!!! </p>
